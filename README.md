# Fullstack React Quiz

## Introduction

The following assignment will be used to test your React + Redux ability. React + Redux are core tools that are utilized everyday here and an sufficient knowledge is necessary.

In order to get a good understanding of where your skills lie, I've designed a simple web application that must utilize React + Redux. The application will be a simple **quiz game** that asks 10 questions and returns the success percentage afterwards.

It is crucial that Redux is used in the best way possible way in this application, and how it is used will be key to the success of the project. 

The project will be due by **Tuesday, April 17 @ 11:59pm**. Please fork the repo and make it public.


## Design

The web application should be composed of three main components:

1. **Introduction screen**
2. **Question screen**
3. **Result screen**


##### Introduction Screen

This screen simply states:

"Welcome to the Trivia Challenge!"
"You will be presented with 10 True or False Questions"
"Can you score 100%?"

...with a button prompting the user to begin the quiz.

##### Quiz screen 

The quiz is a sequence of 10 screens all asking different True or False questions.

Each quiz question screen will look as follows:

Category: Sport (replace with your category name)
Question: "Catching a catfish with your barehands is called Noodling? (replace with your question)

...and two buttons for True or False.

##### Result screen

This screen shows the result out of 10 of right answers that were scored with all the records of each answer.

For example:

....

Results

[+] True: Catching catfish with your barehands is called Noodling.
[-] .....

With "+" meaning correct and "-" meaning incorrect.

Your score was 3/10.


This screen should also include a way to play again.


## Conclusion

This task is meant to test your code quality, use a React features and fluency in Redux.

Thank you very much for your interest in working here at Welbi.
